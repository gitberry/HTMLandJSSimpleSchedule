# HTML and JS Simple Schedule

Simple HTML and javascript to provide a schedule for an event - was a quick demonstration for a non-profit board to show what possibilities exist for online information disemination. 

Ues a little JavaScript to show the events for the current day - otherwise they are all minimized. 

Mobile-first HTML approach.
